Space Fighter is an arcade game project inspired by retro games such as Space Invaders (in some way).
This game is an endless runner with one type of enemies and two types of weapon: bullets and missles. Using bullets you can kill one enemy or destroy an enemy bullet at a time. A missle has a cooldown time but if your shot is successfull it will destroy all the enemy sprites on the screen.
The game also supports gamepad controls and screen resizing, but both features are buggy and require some additional work to function correctly.
